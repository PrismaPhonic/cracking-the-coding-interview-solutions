# Palindrome Permutation 

## The Problem

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary
words.

## Example
**Input:** Tact Coa

**Output:** True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
